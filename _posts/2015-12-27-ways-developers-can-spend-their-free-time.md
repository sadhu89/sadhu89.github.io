All people have free time (Maybe is not much, but they have), that is not different with developers. This post will discuss how developers can take advantage of their free time to improve their programming skills.

##Attend to meetups 
All main cities are crowded of many meetups about many technologies. You should choose a couple of them and assist regularly. Developers can do networking with very nice people that have a lot of experience in the field and people eager to learn. Even, you can realize a presentation about something you learned. Take a look at [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/).

##Read a book
Nothing can replace the pleasure of reading a great book. The books are the most extensive source of information that allows deep in a specific topic.

##Take a MOOC
Massive Online Open Courses (MOOC) can remove geographic walls. People who lives in cities where they don't find good quality courses can take courses about programming in platforms like Coursera, Edx and Udacity through Internet. 

##Watch screencasts and tutorials
Whereas MOOCs are great resources to learn a lot of topics, there is newer or specific subjects which don't have MOOCs available and in that case is a better option go for screencasts and tutorials. Like the famous [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/) of Ryan Bates.

##Solve online coding challenges
Programming is all about solve problems. Why not improve problem solving skills? I think this works like exercises for the muscles. Solve regularly coding challenges should improve your speed and concentration on solving any kind of problem. Actually, I like [codewars](http://www.codewars.com/) for ruby challenges and [codefights](https://codefights.com/) for compete against other developers.

##Publish a blog
People really domain a topic when they can explain it to others. A blog is a nice way to communicate ideas and experiences to a lot of people at the same time. Also, visitors can give feedback to improve. For example, you can explain with code snippets the way that you solve and issue in a project, explaining the tradeoffs and decisions you took.

## Create a side project
How a developer can show mastery in a very new technology or practice? Well, a nice way to show it is through side projects. Also, the impact that could you reach your project don't have limits. You can show not only your programming skills, else your creativity and entrepreneurship.

##Contribute to open source projects
The open source projects are a great way to gain experience, read good code and know very experienced developers.

##Answer stackoverflow questions
Be able to answer the most difficult questions about a specific topic is one way to differentiate the gurus from the rest of the mortals. Why don't begin to answer questions since today? Stackoverflow is the perfect platform for this.
